# Earthquake in Ecuador: Determining the main factors of the Level of Villages Impact through Socioeconomic Indicators and Mobile Phones Data (2021).

This research is currently being conducted; it aims to determine which metrics had a significant influence regarding the impact that villages suffer during an earthquake. I used socioeconomic variables, such as mobile coverage, education, poverty level, and migration rate. I also estimated the resiliency and concentration indicator using Call Detail Records (CDR) data. Finally, I propose developing an econometric model that associates the number of affected households with the socioeconomic and CDR variables.

So far, I have processed the data and performed an *Exploratory Data Analysis*.
